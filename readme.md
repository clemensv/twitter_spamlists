The list in this folder has been compiled using a search spider 
that finds porn spam bots spamming city name hashtags, like #MÃ¶nchengladbach 
or #Viersen.

The "kiss69.me" operators target multiple languages and countries with
distinct clusters of bot accounts, about 400-500 per language per 
my current analysis. 

The format is compatible with Twitter's block-list import/export format
and uses UserIDs. To see the respective profile, use 
`https://twitter.com/intent/user?user_id={id}` for a listed ID.
